# 🧙‍♀️ **Card Name Generator (CNG) – Comprehensive Guide**

Welcome to the official guide for the **Card Name Generator (CNG)**, a structured evaluation tool designed specifically for the mobile video game *Witches' Path*. The purpose of CNG is to objectively assess and refine proposed card names, ensuring they align strongly with game themes, resonate with players, and remain memorable and distinct.

## 📖 **What is CNG?**

The **Card Name Generator (CNG)** is an evaluation framework that systematically rates potential card names based on their thematic alignment, creativity, linguistic depth, and practical considerations. It employs a weighted scoring system, explicit rubrics, and contextual modifiers to ensure objective and consistent selection of high-quality card names.

## ⚙️ **How Does CNG Work? (Step-by-Step)**

### ✅ **Step 1: Select a Card Name**

- Start by selecting or generating a proposed name for evaluation.

### 📌 **Step 2: Score Categories (1-10)**

Evaluate the proposed name using the following categories. Each category receives a score from 1 (low) to 10 (high). Use the **Explicit Scoring Rubrics** provided below for consistency:

| Category                      | Description                                                    | Weight |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| 🔮 **Thematic**               | Alignment with magic schools, lore, or themes                  | 20%    |
| ✨ **Whimsical**               | Clever, playful, engaging wordplay                             | 15%    |
| 📜 **Idiomatic Familiarity**  | Familiarity and clever use of real-world phrases or idioms     | 10%    |
| 📖 **Metaphorical**           | Symbolic depth, poetic, or layered meanings                    | 10%    |
| 🎨 **Evocative**              | Conjures strong visual or emotional imagery                    | 10%    |
| 📏 **Word Length**            | Conciseness, impact, and memorability                          | 5%     |
| 🌟 **Uniqueness**             | Distinctive, stands out within game context                    | 15%    |
| 🗣️ **Phonetic Quality**       | Fluid pronunciation, rhythm, impactful consonant/vowel sounds  | 15%    |


### 🧮 **Step 3: Calculate Weighted Base Score**

Multiply each category's score by its weight and sum these for your **Base CNG Score**:

```
Base CNG Score = (Thematic × 0.20) + (Whimsical × 0.15) + (Idiomatic Familiarity × 0.10) + (Metaphorical × 0.10) + (Evocative × 0.10) + (Word Length × 0.05) + (Uniqueness × 0.15) + (Phonetic Quality × 0.15)
```

### 🎲 **Step 4: Apply Context Modifiers**

Context modifiers can adjust your Base CNG Score slightly to reflect unique situational elements. Apply modifiers as follows (maximum cumulative adjustment ±2 points):

| Modifier                   | Effect        | Condition                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Character-Specific**     | +1 Thematic   | Closely tied to specific character origins or storylines   |
| **Story Milestone**        | +1 Evocative  | Resonates strongly at critical narrative moments           |
| **Spell School Alignment** | +1 Thematic   | Perfect alignment with a core magic school or iconic spell |
| **Clever Mechanic**        | +1 Whimsical  | Cleverly integrated with unique gameplay mechanics         |
| **Common Usage Penalty**   | -1 Uniqueness | Similar to frequently-used names in-game                   |
| **Narrative Disconnect**   | -1 Thematic   | Conflicts with established lore or tone                    |
| **Awkward Adaptation**     | -1 Idiomatic  | Forced, unnatural use of idioms or phrases                 |

### 📝 **Step 5: Finalize the Score**

After applying modifiers, you have your **Final CNG Score**. Use this to decide whether to keep, modify, or discard the name:

| Final CNG Score | Decision Recommendation              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **≥ 7.5**       | ✅ **Accept** - Ready to implement    |
| **5.0–7.4**     | ⚖️ **Review** - Consider adjustments |
| **< 5.0**       | ❌ **Reject** - Seek alternative      |

### 📚 **Step 6: Document Results**

Record the evaluation details clearly for future reference, comparison, or revision.
